The challenge during the process is trying to picture what code would give us. For example, the code x=x+1 would make x increase, but then I need to apply them to a vairable and picture what I would look like.
The functions of random, variation is size makes more sense now. I can apply then to drawings to make things move around and increasing or decreasing the size.
I'm proud that I could make the leaves fall at different rate, it looks pretty natural.
